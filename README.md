# DEALIoT

DEALIoT is a production-oriented real-time IoT data platform for multimodal telemetry, media metadata, schema governance, stream processing, orchestration, and operational compliance evidence.

The platform targets livestock, precision agriculture, and industrial IoT deployments where device telemetry, GPS data, media objects, and governance evidence must be processed reliably from edge ingestion to curated datasets.

## Why Teams Adopt DEALIoT

DEALIoT is designed for teams that need to move beyond isolated IoT demos into governed, reproducible, production-ready data flows. The adoption thesis is simple: prove one field data source, one event contract, one useful output, and one operational decision path before scaling the architecture.

Strong first-fit scenarios include livestock telemetry, WildFi decoding, precision agriculture, industrial IoT hardening, research dataset publication, EU data-sharing readiness, managed hosting evaluation, and device or platform integrations.

## Fast Adoption Path

1. Confirm fit with the [use case catalog](docs/community/use-case-catalog.md).
2. Compare alternatives with the [architecture comparison guide](docs/community/architecture-comparison-guide.md).
3. Run the [quick evaluation path](docs/community/quick-evaluation-path.md) and capture the first event reaching Kafka.
4. Help an internal owner make the case with the [internal champion kit](docs/community/internal-champion-kit.md).
5. Scope one 30-day pilot with the [demo pilot playbook](docs/community/demo-pilot-playbook.md).
6. Score the pilot with the [validation scorecard](docs/community/validation-scorecard.md).
7. Publish an approved lesson, adopter story, or integration note using the [public launch kit](docs/community/public-launch-kit.md).

The recommended adoption path is: validate the local smoke test, run a 30-day pilot with one data
source and one value output, then harden the target runtime with the production deployment
guardrails.

The recommended community path is: ask usage questions in GitHub Discussions, open issues only for
confirmed bugs or scoped changes, share pilot feedback with the user feedback template, and convert
repeated questions into documentation or tests.

### Production Architecture Principles

- Kubernetes is the primary production target.
- Docker Swarm remains available for simpler runtime deployments and smoke validation.
- Stateful dependencies are externalized in production unless managed by a dedicated operator.
- Runtime dependency traffic is encrypted or private: Kafka `SASL_SSL`, MQTT TLS, S3 TLS, PostgreSQL private connectivity, and Redis private connectivity.
- Kubernetes production uses default-deny NetworkPolicies, Pod Security `restricted`, immutable image tags, readiness/liveness probes, HPA, PDB, and topology spread constraints.
- Secrets are expected from a secret manager, External Secrets Operator, or equivalent out-of-band mechanism.

## Event Topics

Core runtime topics include:

| Topic | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `raw.sensor` | Device telemetry and decoded WildFi sensor payloads |
| `raw.gps` | GPS and GNSS events |
| `raw.image2d.meta` | 2D image metadata |
| `raw.image3d.meta` | 3D image metadata |
| `raw.video2d.meta` | 2D video metadata |
| `raw.video3d.meta` | 3D video metadata |
| `media.object.events` | Object storage notifications |
| `features.events` | Derived feature events |
| `state.latest` | Compacted latest state projection |
| `dlq.events` | Invalid or unroutable event records |

Governance, Data Act, DGA, security, resilience, and compliance evidence topics are defined in `docker-compose.yml`, `apicurio/bootstrap/`, and `docs/runbooks/security-resilience-compliance.md`.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine with Compose v2
- Python 3.12 or newer for local tests
- `uv` for reproducible Python tooling
- Rust toolchain for native MQTT-Kafka bridge checks
- `kubectl` for rendering Kubernetes overlays

### Configure Local Secrets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p secrets
```

Populate the secret files listed in `README` runbooks and `.env.example`. Local secrets must stay outside Git; `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` exclude `.env` and `secrets/`.

### Start The Development Stack

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

Useful local endpoints when the development overlay is active:

| Service | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Airflow | `http://localhost:8088` |
| Flink | `http://localhost:8081` |
| Apicurio Registry | `http://localhost:8082/apis/registry/v3` |
| Management Console | `http://localhost:8090` |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Prometheus | `http://localhost:9090` |
| SeaweedFS S3 | `http://localhost:8333` |

### Run The End-To-End Smoke Test

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-e2e.sh
```

The smoke test starts the core event-flow services, submits the minimal Flink job, publishes MQTT fixtures, validates Kafka topics, verifies Apicurio artifacts, and captures diagnostics on failure.

## Production Deployment

### Kubernetes

The production overlay is located at `deploy/kubernetes/overlays/production`.

Before deployment:

1. Replace all `sha-REPLACE_WITH_RELEASE_SHA` image tags with immutable release SHA tags.
2. Replace example dependency endpoints in `runtime-config.production.example.env`.
3. Provide `dealiot-secrets` through a secret manager or External Secrets Operator.
4. Narrow NetworkPolicy `ipBlock` ranges to real private dependency CIDRs.
5. Confirm metrics-server or another HPA metrics provider is installed.

Render locally:

```bash
kubectl kustomize deploy/kubernetes/overlays/production >/tmp/dealiot-production.yaml
```

Apply through your GitOps controller or deployment pipeline after replacing all placeholders.

### Docker Swarm

The Swarm stack is located at `deploy/swarm/dealiot-stack.yml` and expects external Kafka, MQTT, S3, PostgreSQL, and Redis services.

```bash
docker stack config -c deploy/swarm/dealiot-stack.yml
docker stack deploy -c deploy/swarm/dealiot-stack.yml dealiot
```

Create required Swarm secrets before deployment. See `deploy/swarm/README.md` for the exact contract.

## Runtime Security

The production runtime contract requires:

- Kafka `SASL_SSL` with SCRAM credentials.
- MQTT TLS on port `8883` by default.
- Management Console bearer-token protection for `/api/*` and mutation routes.
- Kubernetes Pod Security `restricted` on production and CI smoke namespaces.
- Default-deny Kubernetes NetworkPolicies.
- Immutable image tags and CI checks that reject mutable tags and unresolved placeholders.
- Container resources, readiness/liveness probes, dropped Linux capabilities, and disabled service-account token automounting.

## Testing And Quality Gates

Run the same validation layers used by CI:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -p "test_*.py" -v
cargo test --workspace
uv run python -m unittest -v tests/integration/test_platform_integration.py
uv run --with PyYAML python -m unittest -v tests/deployment/test_deployment_readiness.py
uv run python -m unittest -v tests/test_application_smoke.py
```

Additional CI gates include:

- Pre-commit hooks: YAML, JSON, Ruff, Mypy, djLint.
- CodeQL, Bandit, OSSAR, OSV Scanner, SonarQube, and Codacy coverage upload.
- Docker image builds with SBOM and provenance attestations.
- Kubernetes render and server-side dry-run validation.
- Docker Swarm render and smoke deployment validation.
- kind smoke deployment for the bridge image.
