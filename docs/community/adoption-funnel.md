# Adoption Funnel

This funnel converts attention into adoption decisions. It should guide README structure, website copy, community triage, and release notes.

## Funnel Stages

| Stage | User question | Repository answer | Conversion signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Awareness | What is this and why should I care? | Website, README pitch, public launch kit | User clicks docs or stars repository |
| Fit | Does this match my use case? | Use case catalog and architecture docs | User selects a data source |
| Trial | Can I run it? | Local development path and smoke test | First event reaches Kafka |
| Trust | Can this survive production constraints? | Production readiness, tests, runbooks, support boundaries | User opens pilot or hardening discussion |
| Adoption | Can we commit to this? | Pilot playbook, scorecard, adopter story template | Pilot scorecard completed |
| Expansion | Can others integrate or operate it? | Partner guide, DealHost boundaries, feedback loop | Partner integration or managed hosting scope |

## Weekly Funnel Review

Ask:

- Where did users stop?
- Which question repeated?
- Which command or page failed to move them forward?
- Which use case created the strongest signal?
- Which artifact should be improved before promoting more broadly?

## Minimum Viable Popularity

Do not optimize for stars alone. A healthier early target is:

- 3 concrete demo requests.
- 2 external questions converted into documentation.
- 1 partner integration proposal with fixture and owner.
- 1 pilot scorecard completed.
- 1 approved adopter story or private reference.
